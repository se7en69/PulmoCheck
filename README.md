# PulmoCheck: Lung Cancer Risk Assessment App ü´Å

PulmoCheck is a powerful, interactive web application built using Streamlit that assists users in assessing lung cancer risk based on symptoms and other patient data. The app leverages machine learning to predict lung cancer risk levels, analyze risk factors, and provide tools for exploring and understanding lung health data. It‚Äôs designed for educational purposes, helping users gain insights into potential lung health risks, though it should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.

## Key Features
1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Visualize and explore lung cancer-related data with histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps.
   - Understand trends, patterns, and relationships among features to gain deeper insights into risk factors.
   
2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Train and evaluate different machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) to predict lung cancer risk levels.
   - Tune model hyperparameters and see accuracy scores, cross-validation results, and confusion matrices for each model.

3. **Risk Factor Analysis**:
   - Assess the impact of various risk factors on lung cancer severity levels.
   - Visualize data through box plots, distribution plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify significant predictors of lung health.

4. **Patient Profile Viewer**:
   - View detailed patient profiles with symptoms, risk factors, and health status.
   - Use radar charts and text reports to get a holistic view of individual patient conditions and symptom severity.

5. **Symptom Checker**:
   - Enter symptoms to check potential lung cancer risk levels.
   - Get an instant assessment based on symptom severity, backed by machine learning predictions.
